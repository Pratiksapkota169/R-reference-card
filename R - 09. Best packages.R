Allow machine to capture complexity:
	1. gbm
	2. randomForest
	3. e1071 (SVM)
Take advantage of high-cardinality caterical or text data
	4. glmnet
	5. tau
make code more efficient:
	6. Matrix
	7. SOAR (Used to store large R objets in the cache and release memory)
	8. forEach (used for parallel processing to speed up computation)
	9. doMC (used for parallel processing to speed up computation)
	10.data.table (For doing fast data aggregation operations at scale)
	
Others:
	doParallel
	caret
